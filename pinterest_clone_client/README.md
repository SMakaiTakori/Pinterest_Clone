## Welcome to my Pinterest Clone App!

This is my Pinterest Clone App made with Ruby on Rails and React/Redux that allows users search for images that they would like to view, I used the Pixabay API to fetch images for this app.

In order to use this app, clone it, run "bundle install" and "rails db:seed" to install the dependencies and seed the categories, then run the rails server in your terminal before going into the client side and running "npm start" to start the frontend server. 

## Usage

You can search for anything your heart desires, then press the 'Get Images' button and your images will appear. 

If you are having trouble deciding what to search for, just select one of the popular categories below the search option and voila! 

Click on the images that you want to pin as your favorites! You will then see your favorites appear in their own section on the page. 

Happy Searching!
