               This app is a Pinterest clone, created using a Rails backend and the Pixabay external API. <br/>
               You can search for anything your heart desires, then press the <em>Search</em> button and your 
               images will appear. <br/>If you are having trouble deciding what to search for, just select one of 
               the popular categories below the search option and voila! <br/> Click on the images that you want to
               pin as your favorites! You can then view your pins by clicking the 'My Pins' link in the 
               navigation bar. You can also click a word in the 'Search History' section and it will bring up images that you 
               previously searched for. Happy Searching!
